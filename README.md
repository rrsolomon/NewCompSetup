# NewCompSetup
This is the process that I go through when setting up my Windows PC's. For my version of Windows I use [YetAnotherMorty's Windows 10 Pro - Awesome Edition](https://github.com/YetAnotherMorty/Windows-10-Awesome-Edition), which has had the bloatware and spyware removed from the Windows 10 installation. This package also contains all of the nessesary instructions to complete this task.

***Note:** At the end of every step, you should add a restore point just to make your setup little more secure, but that is completely up to you. I personally do this after each major step, so after debloat, and after installing new programs.*

## Steps
0. Install Windows 10
1. Fresh installation Restore Point.
2. Debloat Windows using the [Sycnex's Windows 10 Debloater](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater).
3. Install preffered programs through Ninite.
4. Install [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/download/), [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/download/), and [Only Office](https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/download-desktop.aspx).
5. Disable Windows 10 Updates
6. MSConfig activate all the core of your computer.
7. Allow 1Gbps transfer speeds
8. Setup Documents, Videos, Pictures, Downloads, and Music folders to "Storage (G:)" hard drive.
9. Set-Up NAS-Storage
10. Some things to do after installation.

## Step 0: Install Windows 10
This section will go over the basic installation process of Windows 10 Pro - Awesome Edition. You can skip this system if you've already installed Windows 10.

## Step 1: Fresh Installation Restore Point
The first thing that we should do is set up a "Fresh Install" restoration point for windows. This set is rather simple, and I suggest that you do it after every one of these steps to make sure everything that you have backups of what you did, so if you did some configurations that you don't want, you can simply rollback.
