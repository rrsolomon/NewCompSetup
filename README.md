# NewCompSetup
This is the process that I go through when setting up my Windows PC's. For my version of Windows I use [YetAnotherMorty's Windows 10 Pro - Awesome Edition](https://github.com/YetAnotherMorty/Windows-10-Awesome-Edition), which has had the bloatware and spyware removed from the Windows 10 installation.

***Note:** At the end of every step, you should add a restore point just to make your setup little more secure, but that is completely up to you. I personally do this after each major step, so after debloat, and after installing new programs.*

## Steps
1. Fresh installation Restore Point.
2. Debloat Windows using the [Sycnex's Windows 10 Debloater](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater).
3. Install preffered programs through Ninite.
4. Install [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/download/), [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/download/), and [Only Office](https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/download-desktop.aspx)
5. Disable Windows 10 Updates
6. MSConfig activate all the core of your computer.
7. Allow 1Gbps transfer speeds
