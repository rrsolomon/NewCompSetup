# New Computer Setup
This is the process that I go through when setting up my Windows PC's. For my version of Windows I use [YetAnotherMorty's Windows 10 Pro - Awesome Edition](https://github.com/YetAnotherMorty/Windows-10-Awesome-Edition), which has had the bloatware and spyware removed from the Windows 10 installation. This package also contains all of the nessesary instructions to complete this task. Mind you, you don't necessarily have to use this version of Windows. You can just intsall the latest version of Windows and follow the instructions below.

***Note:** At the end of every step, you should add a restore point just to make your setup little more secure, but that is completely up to you. I personally do this after each major step, so after debloat, and after installing new programs.*

## Steps
0. Install Windows 10
1. Fresh installation Restore Point.
2. Debloat Windows using the [Sycnex's Windows 10 Debloater](https://github.com/Sycnex/Windows10Debloater).
3. Install prefered programs through [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) or [Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com/)
4. Install [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/download/), [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/download/), and [Only Office](https://www.onlyoffice.com/en/download-desktop.aspx).
5. Disable Windows 10 Updates
6. MSConfig activate all the core of your computer.
7. Allow 1Gbps transfer speeds
8. Setup Documents, Videos, Pictures, Downloads, and Music folders to "Storage (S:)" hard drive.
9. Set-Up NAS-Storage
10. Some things to do after installation.
